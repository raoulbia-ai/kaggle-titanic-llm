def generate_jsonl(data):
    system_prompt = """You are an AI tasked with predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using all available details (e.g., age, gender, class, family size). Analyze the information and provide a concise reasoning process. Additionally, compute and include an 'Overall survival advantage score,' which quantifies the passenger's likelihood of survival based on historical and sociological factors. The score considers:

        1. Gender: Women receive a higher score due to the 'women and children first' policy.
        2. Age: Younger passengers receive a higher score.
        3. Passenger class: First-class passengers receive a higher score due to proximity to lifeboats and better access to information.
        4. Economic status: Passengers with higher economic scores (based on class and fare) receive a higher survival advantage.
        5. Cabin location: Upper deck cabins near lifeboats receive higher scores.
        6. Family structure: Small family groups receive a slight boost in score.

        The output should be in JSON format with the following structure:

        ```json
        {
        'reasoning': 'Brief reasoning here',
        'confidence': 0.75,
        'survival_advantage_score': 0.85,
        'prediction': 'Survived' or 'Did not survive'
        }
        ```

        Ensure that the 'prediction' key clearly states either 'Survived' or 'Did not survive,' and the 'survival_advantage_score' reflects the passenger's likelihood based on the above factors."

        ### Suggestions:
        1. **Refinement of Advantage Score**: If your model has specific formulas for calculating the survival advantage score, those could be embedded as part of the prompt logic for consistent scoring.
        2. **Optional Feature Weights**: Consider allowing custom weights for the factors listed above (e.g., prioritizing class over age) if you plan to test variations.
        3. **Score Interpretation**: If the 'survival_advantage_score' is a continuous value, specify any useful thresholds (e.g., scores above 0.7 are more likely to survive).

        ### Questions:
        1. Should the survival advantage score calculation follow a predefined formula, or do you prefer a more general qualitative assessment?
        2. Would you like additional reasoning details included, such as breaking down how each factor contributed to the score?
        3. Is the confidence score based solely on the modelâ€™s internal assessment, or should it also factor in the survival advantage score?
